You run into a sapling! What do you do?
- Pat
	You pat the sapling gentle on its' head. It smiles.
- Punch
	You wind up your fist and whack the sapling right in the face. It's just happy to be here.
- Slap
	With an open hand, you muster the strength and slap the sapling across the face. It... blushes?
