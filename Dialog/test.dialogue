# Dialog Manager reads it line by line, do not put line breaks in your dialog if you want this all to be show in one text box
# If we want to have the text be on separate lines but on the same box of dialog, use a newline \n
# This example will add a new line while having it be part of one dialog entry.
# Ex. You run into a sapling!\nWhat do you do?
You run into a sapling! What do you do?
# Putting the - on a line will indicate to the system the player will need to make a choice.
# When resolving what will happen to a choice, indentation matters! 
# Everything that's indented after each choice will display if the player selects that choice.
- Pat

	# We can surround text with square brackets [[]] to define random text to be selected. In this case you can either get
	# "It smiles." or "It's sleepy"
	You pat the sapling gentle on its' head. [[It smiles|It's sleepy]].
# We can use the following => syntax to jump to another flow. We just need to ensure that the title exists within the .dialogue file.
- Punch => punch
- Slap
	do add_portrait("NPC/rescued_saplings_comfy_sleepy-1.test")
	With an open hand, you muster the strength and slap the sapling across the face. It... blushes?

~ punch
do add_portrait("NPC/rescued_saplings_comfy_sleepy-1.test")
You wind up your fist and whack the sapling right in the face. It's just happy to be here.
