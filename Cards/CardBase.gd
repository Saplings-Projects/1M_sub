extends Resource
class_name CardBase
## Resource that holds data about a card and provides functions that all derived cards could
## use if they want.
##
## The intention with this is to provide functionality that is common to a lot of cards,
## like dealing damage, drawing cards, and restoring resources.[br]
## If you want functionality that's unique to a certain card, then create a new child of this
## and override one of the functions below.[br]
## This resource also has data that is used for displaying the card in the world, like
## description, title, and key art.[br]
## This includes functionality for applying damage to both the target and caster. Casters may
## wish to take damage in some contexts.[br]
## For example, consider the card: "Deal 10 damage to all enemies, but take 3 damage"

## Define the type of entity this card can be played on [br]
## Possible values: see [enum GlobalEnums.ApplicationType]
@export var application_type: GlobalEnums.ApplicationType = GlobalEnums.ApplicationType.ENEMY_ONLY

## The name of the card
@export var card_title: String = "NULL"

## The art used on the card (ie the image at the top, not the layout of the card)
@export var card_key_art: ImageTexture = null

## The description of the card
@export var card_description: String = "NULL"

## A list of the effects that the card will apply when played [br]
## Effect data is not purely the effect, it also contains information about targets among other things, see [EffectData]
@export var card_effects_data: Array[EffectData] = []

## How much energy is needed to play this card
@export var energy_info: EnergyData = EnergyData.new()

## Used to check the order in which effects and related animations are played

## Used to check which targets have been hit by an effect [br]
