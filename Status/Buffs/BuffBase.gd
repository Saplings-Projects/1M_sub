extends StatusBase
class_name BuffBase
## This class doesn't do much for now except for being a container for all the buff
##
## This is useful to directly know if a certain file is a buff given its parent
## which was not the case when we just had StatusBase [br]
## This can be used later to have different visuals or different objects being modified by buffs or debuffs
