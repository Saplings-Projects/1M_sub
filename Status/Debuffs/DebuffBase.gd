extends StatusBase
class_name DebuffBase

## This class doesn't do much for now except for being a container for all the debuff
## This is useful to directly know if a certain class is a debuff given its parent
## which was not the case when we just had StatusBase
## This can be used later to have different visuals or different objects being modified by buffs or debuffs
