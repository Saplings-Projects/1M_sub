class_name StressComponent extends EntityComponent
## Holds entities stress
##
## Allows entities to deal stress damage or sooth. Manages stress generation

## Emit when stress is changed
signal on_stress_changed(new_stress: int)

## Know if an entity has been calmed already or not [br]
## This is used to not distribute XP twice for the same entity, even if it is calmed multiple times [br]
## An enemy can be calmed multiple times if the player uses an effect that stresses the enemy, even
## if the enemies don't generate stress naturally when they are soothed.

## Know if an entity has hit the overstress threshold [br]
## This prevents the player from hitting the threshold during its turn and then calming the entity to avoid the attack [br]

## The current stress the entity has [br]
## Between 0 and [member StressComponent.max_stress]
var current_stress: int

## @Override [br]
## Initialize the stress component, putting stress to max stress [br]
## This does not happen at game start for the player, as only enemies have a stress component [br]
## For enemies, this is called when the scene is instantiated (or more accurately, when each enemy is instanciated) [br]
